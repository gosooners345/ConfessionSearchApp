The Apostle's Creed
CREED~I believe in God, the Father Almighty,|the Maker of heaven and earth,|and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:|Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,|born of the virgin Mary,|suffered under Pontius Pilate,|was crucified, dead, and buried;|He descended into hell.|The third day He arose again from the dead;|He ascended into heaven,|and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty;|from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.|I believe in the Holy Ghost;|the holy catholic church;|the communion of saints;|the forgiveness of sins;|the resurrection of the body;|and the life everlasting.|Amen.
