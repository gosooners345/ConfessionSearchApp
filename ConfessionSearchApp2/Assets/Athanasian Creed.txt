Athanasian Creed
CREED~1~1.Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith;Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.|2. And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;|3. Neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance|4. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son and another of the Holy Spirit.|5. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal.|6. Such as the Father is, such is the Son and such is the Holy Spirit.|7. The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated.|8. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Spirit incomprehensible.|9. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.|10. And yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal.|11. As also there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensibles, but one uncreated and one incomprehensible.|12. So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty;|13. And yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.|14. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God;|15. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.|16. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit Lord;|17. And yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord.|18. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord;|19. so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say: There are three Gods or three Lords.|20. The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.|21. The Son is of the Father alone; not made nor created, but begotten.|22. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.|23. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.|24. And in this Trinity none is afore, nor after another; none is greater, or less than another.|25. But the whole three persons are co-eternal, and co-equal.|26. So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.|27. He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.|28. Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.|29. For the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.|30. God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and made of the substance of His mother, born in the world.|31. Perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.|32. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching His manhood.|33. Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ.|34. One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the manhood into God.|35. One altogether, not by the confusion of substance, but by unity of person.|36. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ;|37. Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead;|38. He ascended into heaven, He sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty;|39. From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.|40. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies;|41. And shall give account of their own works.|42. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.|43. This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.
